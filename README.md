## Welcome to Mr. Marchant's Example Page!

This page is designed to show a simple, straightforward example of what can be put together on GitHub pages with minimal work. There isn'y anything exciting in the GitHub repository linked above, just access to the Markdown code used to make this site if you want to see it. Everything else I made is at [my main website](https://mrmarchant.com/).

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mremarchant/ExampleSite/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
